## 1. Defining Classes
The main purpose of this part is to create a small and simple bank account system with some method such as: Create, Deposit, Withdraw, Print (See Balance) and End (Exit the program).
This is the result by GIF file: </br></br>

## 2. Abstraction
First, I had to write a console program that can print the rhombus size **n** (**interger input from keyboard**). </br></br>

## 3. Encapsulation
In this part, I had to write a console program that sort the input people by their name and age. Result: </br></br>

Then print their salary increase with the condition: "People younger than 30 **get half the increase**". Result: </br></br>

Besides, the Person class musts contains the validation for the Name, Age and Salary fields. Particularly:
- Names must be at least 3 symbols
-	Age must not be zero or negative
-	Salary can't be less than 460.0 </br>

Result: </br></br>

Finally is add those people into First and Reserve Team. People who are younger than 40 go to the first team, others go to the reverse team. At the end print the sizes of the first and the reserved team. Result: </br></br>

## 4. Inheritance
As this part's name, I had practiced with the Inheritance property. First was single inheritance. Next was multiple inheritance. Then was hierachical inheritance. </br></br>

After that, I had practiced with the **RandomList** with the function that returns and removes a random element from the list. Result: </br></br>

Finally was the Stack practicing with the functions: Push(), Pop(), Peek(), IsEmpty(). Result: </br></br>

## 5. Polymorphism
The first purpose of this part is to do some math operations by writing and calling function. </br></br>

Next, similar with **MathOperations** above, the animal should explain themselves also by writing and calling function. </br></br>

Finally is writing a program that can calculate Perimeter and Area of a specific shape by override the calculate methods from the **Shape** class. </br></br>
